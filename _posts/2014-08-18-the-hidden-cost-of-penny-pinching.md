# The Hidden Cost of Penny Pinching
<!-- <h2 class="subtitle">From download to upload</h2> -->

I’ll say it—I’m a tight wad. I’m really careful about spending money, and I’m even more careful of recurring expenses. An example of this is my having barely entered the smartphone world 3 months ago. Had I wanted a smartphone for a long time? Yes. Did I have adequate funds to pay for such a smartphone? Yes. Did it take me 5 years to finally buy a smartphone? Yes. Did I buy a Galaxy 5? Ohhhh yaaa! But that’s beside the point :-) The real message is that I am naturally slow to spend money.

Before we start though, let me tell you a little bit about my setup so you will know if this is what you want to accomplish.

Lately, however, that has started to change. I’ve realized that while I can do a lot of things on my own, thereby saving money, I’m usually trading an even more valuable commodity, my time.

Here’s the debate that takes place in my mind when I have to make a decision for spending money on a service.

>Hm… how much is that going to cost?

>Ouch… that’s a little more than I’d like to spend. I wonder if I could build it. It really shouldn’t take too long, and once its built it will be completely free to me.
>
>… … …

> **LERRRROOOOY JEEENNNNKINS**, let’s build it. (those unfamiliar with this reference just need to know it is a battle cry for charging forward with reckless abandon)

I’ve fallen into this trap far too many times. The problem is that I have an overly optimistic estimator because all I ever examine is the initial upfront cost. But just like an ugly contract, there are always hidden fees, and they usually turn out to be even heftier than the original cost.

I experienced this on a larger scale at a previous job.

### The Trap

Company X needed a mailing system. It needed to do X, Y and Z. There were off the shelf options, but they seemed too expensive at the time so the company opted to build an internal solution. The programming was not difficult and within a short amount of time they had a working solution. Fast forward three years, and Company X was still using the same mailing system. The only problem was due to new needs that had arisen in the past three years, it was now a hack job. Company X didn’t specialize in mailing systems, and so when a new need arose, the mailing system was modified just barely enough to make do.

As you can imagine, this led to all sorts of bugs. Bugs that perpetually required  immediate developer attention, interrupting sprint momentum, and more alarming, potentially costing the company customers.

Was the issue the developers? I’d personally say no. The issue was that the company undertook to develop mailing software while its real goals were aligned elsewhere. In the end, the company was left with a subpar solution that was greedily taking developer time and causing issues throughout the company.

### The Lesson

So here’s the takeaway. The cost of doing something is rarely the initial plunge. Think really hard before you decide to build a custom solution. Pay people for what they specialize in. Don’t be foolish and throw money away, but remember that cost estimation needs to include a longterm perspective.

This is the conversation I now have with myself.

>Hm… how much is that going to cost?

>Ouch… that’s a little more than I’d like to spend. I wonder if I could build it. It really shouldn’t take too long, and once its built it will be completely free to me. 
>
>How much maintenance will my solution require, and am I willing to spend that time especially when it becomes inferior to the paid service?

And sometimes I still choose to do my own thing, but more often than not, I choose to pay people for what they specialize in. For a small monthly fee I end up with a far superior tool and more time to work on my niche.
