<!-- <h2 class="subtitle">it's easier than you think</h2> -->

Here’s the problem. Quality freelancers spend too much time finding legitimate clients, and legitimate clients spend too much time finding quality freelancers. 

Lots of people have tried their hand at solving this problem, but there is still a lot of frustration faced by both freelancers and clients. For months now we’ve been working on a better solution.

### The freelancers 

First, how do we help freelancers spend less of their time finding legitimate clients?

Quite simply, we send them links to all of the secret, underground websites you don’t know about. It’s kind of like a black market for freelancers. Actually&mdash;that’s a lie. But I’m sure you wish it were true (and so do we).

The truth is that legitimate clients are randomly dispersed among crappy clients, and there isn’t a secret solution for finding them. Finding is an active, ongoing process, and requires a whole lot of work. 

No way around it; someone has to do the finding, but it doesn’t have to be the freelancer. This is where we step in.

We volunteer as tribute! No, we’re not beautiful archers caught in love triangles, but we take care of the mindless, monotonous, grueling, mind-numbing, soul-sucking work of scouring the web, trudging through public job boards, and picking out the winners. I’m not going to say we like it, but I will say it’s worth it. It’s worth knowing that we are saving the freelancers in our community hundreds of hours every day. Hours that can be spent becoming better at their craft or focusing entirely on current client projects.

Granted, leads coming from public job boards are not ideal as the competition is very high. The key here, though, is that because our freelancers didn’t spend their time searching for these leads, **they actually have time to do some research and** <a href="/standing-out-as-a-freelancer" target="_blank">**submit a targeted pitch**</a>, something most of the competition can’t afford.

Do I hear some heckling from non-believers in the back of the crowd? Something about exacerbating the problem by giving the same leads to too many community members?

Well, we thought of that too. Leads are dispersed based on some fancy algorithms we created that take into account freelancers’ preferences, lead quality, how many times a lead has been sent, and other such criteria. This means that competition within the community is only between a very small subset of the entire population.

Now it’s not a perfect system, and there is a much, MUCH better way, but that depends upon the clients.

### The clients 

So, how do we help clients spend less of their time finding quality freelancers?

To answer this question, let’s examine how the process normally works. John, an owner of a business in Florida, is ready to upgrade his website, and begins seeking out a freelancer. He decides to post his job on Elance, oDesk, Craigslist, or \<insert popular hiring site here>. The initial time commitment to post his project is very minimal. Unfortunately that is not true of the followup as John gets slammed with responses and has to spend hours reviewing potential candidates. Hopefully when it is all over, John’s mental capacities have withstood the onslaught and he has found a top-notch developer.

Why though, did he have to undergo the mindless, monotonous, grueling, mind-numbing, soul-sucking work of finding the right freelancer? Wouldn’t it be nicer if someone else did that work for him? Well, that actually sounds a lot like the same work we do for finding leads. What if there was a way we could both save ourselves the soul-sucking and still get what we wanted?

You see, we have a community of quality freelancers that are US-based, prescreened for quality, and are paying a monthly fee to maintain their membership. They are the type of freelancers you spent all that time searching for&mdash;we just did it for you already.

Normally to get access to this type of exposure, you pay anywhere from $60-$350, or 5–15% of the final project price. We find it a little strange, however, that you who are paying for the project, should be forking out additional money for the exposure.

The Freelance Inbox way is a little different. We think the project you bring to our community is far more valuable than those projects we find on public job boards, and that’s why instead of charging you to share it with our freelancers, <a href="https://freelanceinbox.com/job" target="_blank">we pay you to share it</a>.

### The union 

We’re looking to create a win-win. We’re not greedy; not looking for this community to make us rich and famous. Instead we’re looking to simplify the process by which quality freelancers and legitimate clients come together. 

That’s the Freelance Inbox way&mdash;and we hope you make it your way too.
