# Eliminating <br>Zero-Progress Hours
<h2 class="subtitle">Personal thoughts on becoming more productive</h2>

I hate wasted time. I hate it even more when it occurs during time periods that I intentionally set aside to make progress. Usually the time suck sneaks up on me and before I know it, a particular task has taken me multiple hours, when I know it should have only taken one.

The following are suggestions I have employed in my own work to try and reduce the number of zero-progress hours I log.

### Close your tabs.

One of the methods of procrastination my subconscious employs is clicking through all of the tabs I have open. If I notice myself doing this, I immediately try to close as many as I can. Sometimes, however, I still have 4-5 tabs open with pages that I know I need to come back to. This is bad, because in essence, I turn my tabs into a todo list. And let’s be honest, tabs make for horrible todo lists because they distract you while you work on the current task. Instead of using your tabs as items to address later, put them in a task manager like Trello, or a save-for-later tool like Dragdis. That way they’re not visible until you’re ready to pick up the next task.

### Set time constraints on tasks

When I started writing this blog, I gave myself 30 minutes of solid write time. I don’t know the science behind it, but putting restraints on a task makes me dive deep and stay there. The time restraint doesn’t have to be a time cap, but it does need to be a minimum. If you find that after 30 minutes you are still making great progress, by all means, keep pressing forward.

It’s important to remember that interruptions and distractions waste more time than the actual length of the interruption or distraction. It takes time to dive to an area of focus and the fewer times you have to make that descent, the better.

### Take breaks (and make them count)

There are good breaks and there are bad breaks. The bad breaks are the constant checking of your social feeds hoping and praying that something exciting has occurred in your absence, or hitting up your favorite meme shop. Good breaks help you step away from your computer and reenergize your body and mind. For me these include taking time for lunch, and standing up and walking.

If you’re going to take a break, then take it and make it count. Don’t justify slipping in short breaks here and there that don’t give you anything in return.

### Focus on one task at a time

This is a big one for me. My wife and family members could tell you how many ideas are constantly running through my mind. Even within the domain of the project I’m working on, I usually have several ideas running around. If I don’t structure this brain flow, I find it extremely debilitating. 

To help with this structure, I like to use Trello. I start my day out by creating the following lists: ToDo, Doing, and Done. To the first column, I add the day’s jobs broken down into 30-60 minute tasks—sometimes these are a carryover from the previous day—and as I take and complete tasks throughout the day, I move them to their respective columns. 

During the course of the day, I will have random ideas pop into my mind about the product. If I’m not careful, these begin to cloud my mind and distract me. To combat this, I have another column in Trello that I’ve labeled Memory. If an idea is something that I’m going to accomplish today, I move it to the ToDo column, otherwise it gets put in the Memory. Once it’s in a column, I forget about it.

### Know when to switch sides of the brain

Some days, my tasks consist of rather tedious and monotonous work. But they have to be accomplished. Even with all of the above tips, I hit mental breaking points where I start to become less productive. When I recognize I’m at one of these points, I switch to a different style of activity, like writing (of which this blog post is the result). 

There is a danger to be aware of in this tactic, however. If you’re subconscious knows all it has to do is feign tiredness and you will switch tasks, this can turn into a major distraction. To avoid this, you have to be honest with yourself before making the switch. Is your brain tired, or are you just trying to find relief from your current task?

Forty minutes have come and gone for me and now it’s time for a quick stretch, a movement of Trello cards and a new task. I hope you’ll find some of my tips helpful in your own elimination of zero-progress hours.
