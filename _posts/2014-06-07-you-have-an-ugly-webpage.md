<h1 style="font-size:2.9em">You've got an ugly web page</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">But you want to build mine?</h2>

I’ve done a LOT of searching out freelancers and I’ve seen a lot of their personal webpages. Some of them have been really well done and inspired my own design choices. Others, however, have left me pondering why such an individual or organization would be okay <!--more-->with their home page being their first impression. 

I realize that skill levels are varying and some freelancers are just entering the domain. I’m not really talking about those individuals. I’m talking about the people who appear to have at least some experience, and possibly even a client or two tucked under their belt, but still continue to ignore the fact that their personal webpage is ugly. 

Now I’m not a UI/UX guy skilled in the art of web design, but in all likelihood, neither are your future clients. I’m just a guy who spends time on the web and notices when something looks professional. My guess is your clients notice as well.

### "I’ve tried! How do I get better?"

A tactic that I have found super helpful is to keep a folder of websites that inspire me. To keep organized and making adding to the folder easy, I use [Dragdis](http://dragdis.com){:target="_blank"}. If you are unfamiliar with this app, you should change that. It is incredibly simple, and has converted me from someone who never saved-this-for-later to an avid user.

But, wait! I don’t want to be a copycat! Great, and you shouldn’t be. The chances of you being completely original, however, are slim, especially with your inexperience. Your folder of others’ work is simply a starting place to help you understand what those skilled in the art are doing. Decide what you like, and how those things apply to your site. Most likely you will pull from multiple examples and combine them. Add in your own twist and you have a personalized design that has your touch, but is grounded in proven principles.

I’ve always loved the quote by Isaac Newton about the shoulders of giants.

>If I have seen further, it is by standing on ye shoulder of Giants.

That might be a little dramatic for what we’re talking about, but it illustrates the point. We all benefit from the previous creativity of others, and as long as you are not blatantly copying, you should let them speed you along. Should you still be in doubt, just look at all of the parallax scrolling pages that have popped up. You know that had to have originated with one person and because it was novel and a nice touch, it has popped up everywhere.

### YOU built this!?

Last week one of my friends saw FreelanceInbox for the first time. We had been talking on and off about the idea for 30 minutes and he was moderately interested at best. That was until he pulled out his laptop and saw the site for the first time. His whole perspective changed. Based solely on one page, his perception of my skill level and professionalism had skyrocketed. It was almost comical how night and day it was. That’s the kind of experience you want to have with your clients.

In the coming weeks, I’m going to start analyzing some of the freelancer’s home pages I come across, the good and the bad. My hope is that if you follow along you can see what’s working for freelancers and what’s screaming amateur hour.
