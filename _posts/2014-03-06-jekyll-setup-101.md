# Jekyll Blog Setup 101
<h2 class="subtitle">From download to upload</h2>

After a few too many Wordpress setups, I decided to give Jekyll a try. For the most part, everything was pretty straightforward, but I did hit a couple of snafoo's I hope to be able to carry you through.

Before we start though, let me tell you a little bit about my setup so you will know if this is what you want to accomplish.
* My blog is hosted on Github at finbox.github.io.
* I have the subdomain blog.freelanceinbox.com pointed to that github page.
* I test my blog in a local environment before I push it live.

Alrighty, if you're still reading, I'm assuming you are interested in a similar setup.

## Step #1 - Setup Github
![alt text](/images/tutorials/github-signup.png "Github signup")

Navigate to Github.com and fill their form to signup. **Note that the username you select will influence the url** your site will be hosted under at github.io. For instance, we selected our username to be finbox, which meant that our blog would be hosted under **finxbox.github.io**.

Next, create a repository named *your-username.github.io*. As an example, our repo was called finbox.github.io. After the repository is made, you need to add an index.html file. This step isn't crucial, but it will help you to know you did Step #1 correctly. The easiest way to do this is to follow steps 2-4 on this <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">page</a>.
 
When that is finished, direct your browser to *your-username.github.io* where you will be greeted with the following page.

Notice how it says, "It may take up to ten minutes..."? They are serious about this. I waited at least 10, maybe 15 minutes before the actual page showed up. So don't panic if it takes awhile.

And that's all for Step #1!

## Step #2 - Make your domain/subdomain point to *your-username.github.io*

Github help pages cover this topic really well and I found everything straightforward. You should follow this <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages" target="_blank">link</a>.

The only thing that threw me off was that even after "dig" was showing that my subdomain was pointing to the correct location, I was getting the 404 page again. This is normal and in fact you just have to wait the mandatory 10-15 minutes again.

## Step #3 - Installing Jekyll

<img src="http://jekyllrb.com/img/logo-2x.png" style="background: #333;">

Couple of things to know. Github compiles Jekyll already, so all of the following steps are just to help you get Jekyll setup on your local environment. If you could write Jekyll perfectly without ever needing to test it locally, you could skip this step and always just push straight to Github. Let's assume, however, that you're like me and you need a little testing first.

Second thing to know is that Jekyll will eventually take all of your files and compile them into a folder called "_site". This folder is dynamically generated, so don't ever edit anything inside of it. Also, you should never push it to your github repository, because Github will compile the "_site" folder for you.

Yet again, Github has done a good job of explaining this step, so I'll pass you along to them. Ahem... <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages?codekitCB=423448232.124805" target="_blank">link</a>. Focus mostly on the "Installing Jekyll" and "Running Jekyll" sections.

Once you have completed those steps, run the following command in your terminal from the root of your repository. 

    bundle exec jekyll serve --watch

This will start a server to preview your files (normally located at 127.0.0.1:4000), compile your Jekyll code, and recompile when you modify any files.

If you look in your repository, you should notice that there is the "_site" folder we talked about. This is where the compiled Jekyll code goes.

We haven't actually written any Jekyll specific code though... so you won't see anything exciting. Let's change that. The following uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) which is a language compiled by Jekyll, but you could also use [Textile](http://textile.sitemonks.com/).

In the root folder of your repository create the following structure.
* layouts 
  * default.html 
* posts
  * 2014-3-06-first-post.md

Inside of default.html paste the following:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
       <title>{{ page.title }}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    
    <div class="site">
      <div class="header">Welcome!</div>
      <!-- This is where your post will be inserted -->
      {{ content }}
    </div>
    </body>
    </html>

And inside of 2014-3-06-first-post.md paste the following:
```

# My first post

Boggarts lavender robes, Hermione Granger Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Bee in your bonnet Hand of Glory elder wand, spectacles House Cup Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans Impedimenta. Stunning spells tap-dancing spider Slytherin’s Heir mewing kittens Remus Lupin. Palominos scarlet train black robes, Metamorphimagus Niffler dead easy second bedroom. Padma and Parvati Sorting Hat Minister of Magic blue turban remember my last.

```
And now let's test it! Go to the following URL:

    http://127.0.0.1:4000/2014/03/06/first-post.html

You should see a page similar to this:

## #Step 4 - Wrapping Up

You now have a working Jekyll blog on your local environment. To get it live, all you have to do is push all of the code (exluding the "_site") file to your Github repository. After being pushed, Github will compile your Jekyll code and within a few seconds your updates should be live.  

If the changes are not showing up, check your email. Github won't compile your code if you haven't verified your email.
