# Standing out as a freelancer&mdash;it's easier than you think
<!-- <h2 class="subtitle">it's easier than you think</h2> -->

I frequently hear from freelancers frustrated that potential clients won’t respond to their emails. To better understand this issue, I posted a project on a popular job board to see the types of responses freelancers are sending out. When the responses started rolling in, I was appalled. The quality was alarmingly poor! In my opinion, without an inordinate amount of luck, 95% of those developers were never going to receive the response they were desperately seeking. Maybe others react differently, but the only response all but a few of those freelancers received from me was a shake of my head and a click of my mouse hitting the delete icon before their message disappeared from my inbox (which might have actually taken more effort than they put into sending their email).

As a freelancer you might be frustrated wondering how in the world you’re going to get noticed amid a crowd of competitors. Based on my experience, the quality of competitors is so low that standing out isn’t as hard as you think.

To increase your success, you need to perfect two parts of your response. The first part is the actual email response you send, which will be covered extensively in this post. The second part relates to your portfolio and will be covered in more detail in a follow-up post.

To perfect your pitch, you should first realize that the following errors immediately disqualify a response.

### Broken links

Yep… you listed a webpage and all I found was a 404 page. Maybe you misspelled it, and if I just looked at the link, I would figure it out. Unfortunately, I have plenty of other responses to consider and this poor first impression means you’re out.

### Reader fatigue

Look at that response. Yes, there are probably a LOT of good words in there, but all I see is gigantic blocks of text. Immediately, my mind becomes lazy and if I even read your email&mdash;which I probably won’t&mdash;I do so grudgingly. 

Use of appropriate whitespace can go a long way in crafting your response. This too can be taken to an extreme if your email starts to grow too tall. The real lesson here is don’t try to cram so much into your email that it is discarded before it’s begun.

Taken to the opposite extreme, don’t send out a one-liner. Unless you have a portfolio that spews rainbows and unicorns, the following type of response is also a no-go.

In short (but not too short *winky-face*), the length of your response should be tailored to the size and quality of job to which you are responding.

### Grammatical issues / Spelling errors 

These type of errors suggest to me that you’re either lazy, careless, or English is not a strong suit. All three are warning flags, and enough to knock you from the top 5%.

### FoRmatTing 

Please… please, none of this. I was aghast at some of the formatting that I witnessed. Yes, you caught my attention, but the kind that sends my mouse racing for the trash can icon.

Font should be uniform throughout your email (especially font-size) and choosing to emphasize portions by bolding should be done tastefully and sparingly. Links are normally blue, and it would take a strong argument to help me understand why you decided to turn them all sea-green.

Also, make sure when including links that they are formatted the same. The following is not OK.

- http://example.com
- second-example.com
- http://www.third-example.com
- wwww.fourth-example.com

I have no insight on which is best, but I do know that sticking with one would be wise.

### Non-relevant additions

My guess is that you were hoping that the right keyword would catch my eye, and so you listed as many as you could. You may really be a master in the twenty different tech keywords you dropped on me, but unfortunately for you, I don’t care about all the different technologies you specialize in, and I got lost in the whirlwind. I asked for proposals for building a simple webpage. Now is not the time to spew forth your resume. The “spray and pray,” while easy, is not an effective method for winning my project.

### Extremes 

You want to come across as sounding experienced, but there is a breaking point. When I see claims like “developed hundreds of websites with millions of pages” you’ve gone too far. As a fellow developer I realize that it’s potentially true, but rather than strengthen your pitch, it makes me question. Find ways to convey your experience without being extreme.

### No link to portfolio or sample pages

An applicant without a personal website always worries me. I’m sure the usefulness of a personal website is highly based on the type of freelance work you are seeking, but in my case, you were proposing to build me a website. Not having a personal website to refer me to makes me wonder how new to the game you are. Even if you included other websites as references, I still questioned.

That being said, some of you did have personal websites and they were unfortunately very unprofessional, which was as bad as not having one. This was probably the most discouraging part of the whole process. Finally, I would come across a pitch that was very well put together, only to be greeted by a poorly done website. I had to wonder why you thought I would pay you to design my website, when <a href="http://blog.freelanceinbox.com/ugly-web-page" target="_blank">your website was so ugly</a>.

A final thought on the links you share. Some emails contained upwards of 10 websites for me to check out. When I checked them out, I was surprised to find that some of them were really well done, while others were not. Unfortunately, due to the lesser quality sites, I eliminated you from my potential hire pool. My suggestion here is that instead of sending 10 sites, you only include 3–4 of your best work. Should you want to show off the rest of your work, your personal website would do a better job than the email. Quality vs. quantity is the key here.

### Attached portfolio

“It’s the 21st century, when are you going to learn to sit down.” Oh wait, that’s a <a href="http://www.juliansmith.tv/2014/07/wifi/" target="_blank">Julian Smith quote</a>. But if you’ve seen the video, (and I’d endorse taking 3 minutes to watch it), you understand that attaching your pdf portfolio when I’m requesting a website isn’t the best approach.

## Diamonds in the Rough 

Ok, sorry for all of the negativity. I was honestly flabbergasted by the number of mistakes I saw and felt addressing some of them individually would be best.

On the flip side, here are some pointers that can help your pitch stand out in a positive way.

### What are you going to do for me? 

This needs to be the driving inspiration behind everything in your pitch. I realize that you are obviously interested in this job because it is going to benefit you, but you need to convince me that it’s really about me. Part of this means not asking me to do unnecessary work.

Take a look at a couple of sample responses:

> “I am a professional WordPress Developer, if you could please fill out the attached document I will get back to you with information and an estimate based on that.”

> “What exactly are you looking for in a website? How many pages? What type of business? Do you have any example sites that you like?”

Obtaining this information is critical to being able to successfully deliver a website. The problem, though, is at this point the client is still trying to decide if you are a good option, and all you are doing is asking them to do more work.

Now take a look at this response:

> “Most small business websites can be developed in about a week depending on page number and complexity. As we hash out details later I can give you a more concrete timeline.”

Sure, with a response like this the freelancer temporarily foregoes all of the nitty gritty details they will eventually need. However, at this point, you have to focus on simplifying life for the client, so that you can actually get to the second step.

This is just one example, but watch for other areas in your response where you are asking the client to do premature work. Figure out what information you can live without in your response and turn it in your favor.

### Make it personal, cordial and friendly 

This could be done a thousand different ways but it begins with your salutation and ends with your name.

Adding some humor to your email is a gamble, but if you succeed, it is also a breath of fresh air. If you can make me smile but still come across as professional, you’re going to make the first round of cuts. Most people like to work with someone who is easy-going and has a sense of humor. They don’t want a goofball, though, so find a balance. They need a professional they can rely on, but if you can come across as fun to work with and professional, you’re golden.

### Timeline 

Providing a timeline is not always appropriate, and is highly dependent on the client’s initial post. In my case, my post made it clear that I didn’t know a whole lot about web development. I found that the few developers who provided a timeline helped me understand what I could expect throughout the whole process. They also didn’t attach dates to make me feel pressured.

The outline went something like this:

> The actual timeline is highly dependent on the details of your project, but a typical project goes as follows:
>
> - 5 days to deliver a website design concept
> - 1–2 weeks for programming
> - You test it
> - 2–4 days for programming changes (if needed)

Instantly a lot of the concerns I had about the process were alleviated. Providing this type of timeline won’t always be the right approach, it all depends on the client’s experience.

### Be confident

A few of you slipped in the sentence, “I think I could get that done for you.” My assumption is that you are trying not to be arrogant or overconfident, but the choice of “I think I could” makes me worried that if I hired you, you might not be able to actually deliver.

The opening pitch is not a time for hesitancy. If you get a response from the client, project details will follow. If at that time you discover the project is outside of your level of expertise, then all you can do is let the client know. Until that point, though, be confident.

### Contact information 

Nothing fancy here, just make sure I have a good easy way of contacting you. This seems like a no-brainer, but unfortunately it was a common mistake. I found that those freelancers that included their phone number in the pitch, came across as far more personal than those who only had it in their signature. 

Another tip is to specify where you are located. Something about saying, “I’m currently located in Boston” helped me establish an immediate connection with that person. I’m not even from Boston; it’s just that their specifying their location changed them from an elusive being existing somewhere out there in the internets, to an actual person fighting the cold winters in Boston.
